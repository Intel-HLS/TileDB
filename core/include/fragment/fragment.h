   * in a set of buffers (one per attribute specified upon initialization).
   * Note that there must be a one-to-one correspondance between the cell
   * values across the attribute buffers.
   *
   * The fragment must be initialized in one of the following write modes,
   * each of which having a different behaviour:
   *    - TILEDB_ARRAY_WRITE: \n
   *      In this mode, the cell values are provided in the buffers respecting
   *      the cell order on the disk. It is practically an **append** operation,
   *      where the provided cell values are simply written at the end of
   *      their corresponding attribute files. This mode leads to the best
   *      performance. The user may invoke this function an arbitrary number
   *      of times, and all the writes will occur in the same fragment. 
   *      Moreover, the buffers need not be synchronized, i.e., some buffers
   *      may have more cells than others when the function is invoked.
   *    - TILEDB_ARRAY_WRITE_UNSORTED: \n
   *      This mode is applicable to sparse arrays, or when writing sparse
   *      updates to a dense array. One of the buffers holds the coordinates.
   *      The cells in this mode are given in an arbitrary, unsorted order
   *      (i.e., without respecting how the cells must be stored on the disk
   *      according to the array schema definition). Each invocation of this
   *      function internally sorts the cells and writes them to the disk on the
   *      proper order. In addition, each invocation creates a **new** fragment.
   *      Finally, the buffers in each invocation must be synced, i.e., they
   *      must have the same number of cell values across all attributes.
   * 
   * @param buffers An array of buffers, one for each attribute. These must be
   *     provided in the same order as the attributes specified in Array::init()
   *     or Array::reset_attributes(). The case of variable-sized attributes is
   *     special. Instead of providing a single buffer for such an attribute,
   *     **two** must be provided: the second holds the variable-sized cell
   *     values, whereas the first holds the start offsets of each cell in the
   *     second buffer.
   * @param buffer_sizes The sizes (in bytes) of the input buffers (there is
   *     a one-to-one correspondence).
   * @return TILEDB_FG_OK for success and TILEDB_FG_ERR for error.
