*--------------- TileDB-Spark README ---------------*

1. Pre-requisite:- Do the following in all the nodes in the cluster

   Ensure OpenMPI libraries are in the load library path. For example,
   the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH can be setup as follows:
   $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$OPENMPI_HOME/lib

   Also, ensure that mpicxx binary is in the path
   $ export PATH=$PATH:$OPENMPI_HOME/bin

   Spark must be installed in all the nodes and SPARK_HOME must be set
   in the environment.

   Once all this is set up, go to the TileDB-Spark home directory and
   source the tiledb-env.sh script as follows:
   $ cd TileDB-Spark
   $ source conf/tiledb-env.sh

2. Compile
   $ make

3. Run
   $ make run ARRAY=ARRAYNAME SPARK_MASTER=spark://sparkmaster:sparkmasterport

4. To use TileDBArray in your Scala code, add the following dependency in the
   Maven:

   <dependency>
     <groupId>com.intel</groupId>
     <artifactId>tiledb-spark</artifactId>
     <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
     <scope>provided</scope>
   </dependency>

   Ensure that at runtime, the tiledb-spark-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar is in the jar path

5. To generate ScalaDoc:
   $ mvn scala:doc
   This generates the code documentation under target/site/scaladocs
